## About me

I love clarity. Therefore, I want to write code in such a way that in a
year I or any other programmer could quickly navigate it.

When doing work, I concentrate and give my best to one hundred
percent in order to get as close as possible to the result of the
experimental one.

Experience in other areas taught me to be consistent, find
innovative solutions, work hard and achieve results. I am sure that
this approach will help me become a professional in programming.
